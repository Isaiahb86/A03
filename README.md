glossary
Branch: a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.
Clone: an exact copy of something such as a repository. Clones of remote repositories are created to have a local copy stored
Commit:  an individual change to a file or set of files
Fetch:  adding changes from the remote repository to local working branch without committing them.
GIT:  an open source program for tracking changes in text files
Github: a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function
Merge:takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.
Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.
Push: to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.
Pull: when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.
Remote: the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.
Repository:  This is the a very basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.
