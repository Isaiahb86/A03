<p><strong>Github</strong> is a website that a lot of programmers use to store or showcase their code. The files for a project are stored in a <strong>repository</strong> and can be accessed by a link and may be edited if the creator allows it. However, the code is usually edited with other software such as <strong>webstorm</strong> or <strong>Git</strong>. Webstrom is usally used for single person editing and Git is known for its collaborative features. Before making changes, it is important to have a <strong>remote</strong><strong> clone</strong> in case the file needs to be reverted back to normal. Webstorm allows a user to <strong>commit</strong> and changes made to a file and <strong>push</strong> it back to github. Git allows multiple <strong>branches</strong> for callaborative work when different pieces need to be made by different people. Once all parties are finished, they can either <strong>merge</strong> the two files together or <strong>pull</strong> one into another. A <strong> merge conflict </strong> will happen if two changes are made to the same line of code of if one of the file get deleted. If the user doesn't want to commit the changes, they can simply <strong>fetch</strong> them instead. </p>

  <strong>Glossary</strong><br>
Branch: a unique set of code changes with a unique name. Each repository can have one or more branches. The main branch â€” the one where all changes eventually get merged back into, and is called master.<br>
Clone: an exact copy of something such as a repository. Clones of remote repositories are created to have a local copy stored<br>
Commit:  an individual change to a file or set of files<br>
Fetch:  adding changes from the remote repository to local working branch without committing them.<br>
GIT:  an open source program for tracking changes in text files<br>
Github: a service to an entire organization and use their own identity when performing their function<br>
Merge:takes the changes from one branch (in the same repository or from a fork), and applies them into another.<br>
Merge Conflict: A difference that occurs between merged branches. Merge conflicts happen when people make different changes to the same line of the same file, or when one person edits a file and another person deletes the same file.<br>
Push: to send your committed changes to a remote repository on GitHub.com.<br>
Pull: when you are fetching in changes and merging them. For instance, if someone has edited the remote file you're both working on, you'll want to pull in those changes to your local copy so that it's up to date.<br>
Remote: the version of a repository or branch that is hosted on a server, most likely GitHub.com.<br>
Repository:  This is the a very basic element of GitHub. They're easiest to imagine as a project's folder. A repository contains all of the project files (including documentation), and stores each file's revision history. Repositories can have multiple collaborators and can be either public or private.<br>
